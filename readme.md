## My bikeshed
This repo is a general catch-all for code that I would like to be able to access from multiple machines or use as a reference as I work. It's not meant to be information, pretty, or even consistently functional.

That being said, I'm releasing all of it that's mine under a general "Do Whatever You Like With It, But Don't Come Crying To Me" license. Copy it. Change it. Post it on Facebook. Print a book called "Jake Bladt is a Terrible Coder" and use it as prima facie evidence. It's all the same to me. It comes with no warranty of any sort, implicit, explicit, real or imaginary. Think of it as the Jarts of source code.

### Secondary uses
In addition to being a general dumping-ground for half-baked coding experiments, this is also my muck room for all things git. So, if you see odd behaviors (like issuing and merging my own pull requests, filling out bug reports for my own work, etc.) that's probably why.
